				<h1>The Strings and Things Guitar Shop - Our Retail Store</h1>
					<p>The Strings and Things Guitar Shop was founded in 1953, with the goal of serving professional musicians as a 
	one-stop source for purchasing, repairing and restoring fine string instruments. </p>
	
	<p>Eventually, the business expanded to serve musicians at all levels and the instrument offerings increased as well.  
	With its broader appeal, the store moved from its original location in the Bronx to Westchester County.  
	Taking over a small warehouse, the company can now offer seminars and workshops.  The facility also is home for a number 
	of musical societies, each with a different focus.  Professional music teachers often use our facilities, 
	and once a month, we hold a "Jammin' Weekend for Professional Musicians.</p>
	
	<p>We would love to meet you and show you how personalized service from experienced professionals can make a difference to you.</p>
