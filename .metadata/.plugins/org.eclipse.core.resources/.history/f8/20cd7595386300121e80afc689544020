	<h2>John Viola - Our Founder</h2>
	<p>John Viola, a classical guitar player, founded our company in 1952.  His goal was to provide a needed 
	resource for both instruments and maintenance of fine string instruments, including repairs and restoration. 
	Although retired, he still can be found helping out at the store.</p>
	
	<h2>Jack Viola - Our President</h2>
	<p>Jack expanded the family business to include electric instruments.  He also moved it from its original 
	location in the Bronx to Westchester County.  Taking over a small warehouse, the company can now offer seminars 
	and workshops.  The facility also is home for a number of musical societies, each with a different focus.  
	Professional music teachers often use our facilities, and once a month, we hold a "Jammin' Weekend for Professional 
	Musicians.</p>
	
	<h2>Gianna Viola-Mandolino</h2>
	<p>Jack's daughter, Gianna, recently joined the business and expanded the product line to include percussion instruments.
