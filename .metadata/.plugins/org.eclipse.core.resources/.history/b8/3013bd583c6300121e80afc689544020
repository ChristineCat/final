	<h2>John Viola - Our Founder</h2>
	<p>John Viola, a classical guitar player, founded our company in 1952.  His goal was to provide a needed 
	resource for both instruments and maintenance of fine string instruments, including repairs and restoration. 
	Although retired, he still can be found helping out at the store.</p>
	
	<h2>Jack Viola - Our President</h2>
	<p>Jack expanded the family business to include electric instruments.  He also moved it from its original 
	location in the Bronx to Westchester County.  Taking over a small warehouse, the company can now offer seminars 
	and workshops.  The facility also is home for a number of musical societies, each with a different focus.  
	Professional music teachers often use our facilities, and once a month, we hold a "Jammin' Weekend for Professional 
	Musicians.</p>
	
	<h2>Gianna Viola-Mandolino</h2>
	<p>Jack's daughter, Gianna, recently joined the business and expanded the product line to include percussion instruments. 
	Gianna is a projessional drummer for the popular "Girls Havin' Fun" rock band.  Her husband, Tony Mandolino, has taken 
	over the responsibility for the maintenance and repair services offered at the Strings and Things Guitar Shop</p>
