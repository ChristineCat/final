<h3>Rodriguez Caballero 11</h3>

<p>Featuring a carefully chosen, solid Canadian cedar top and laminated bubinga back and sides, the Caballero 11 classical <br />
guitar is a beauty to behold and play. The headstock and fretboard are of Indian rosewood. Nickel-plated tuners and <br />
Silver-plated frets are installed to last a lifetime. The body binding and wood rosette are exquisite.</p>
<p>The Rodriguez Guitar is hand crafted and glued to create precise balances. From the invisible careful sanding, even <br />
inside the body, that ensures the finished instrument's purity of tone, to the beautifully unique rosette inlays <br />
around the soundhole and on the back of the neck, each guitar is a credit to its luthier and worthy of being handed down <br />
from one generation to another.</p>
<p>The tone, resonance and beauty of fine guitars are all dependent upon the wood from which they are made. The wood used in<br />
the construction of Rodriguez guitars is carefully chosen and aged to guarantee the highest quality. No wood is <br />
purchased before the tree has been cut down, and at least 2 years must elapse before the tree is turned into lumber. <br />
The wood has to be well cut from the log. The grain must be close and absolutely vertical. The shop is totally free from humidity.</p>
<p>List Price: $415.00</p>
<p>Your Price: $253.15 (You save $161.85)</p>
