<h3>Rodriguez Caballero 11</h3>

<p>Featuring a carefully chosen, solid<br />
Canadian cedar top and laminated bubinga<br />
back and sides, the Caballero 11 classical <br />
guitar is a beauty to behold and play.<br />
The headstock and fretboard are of<br />
Indian rosewood. Nickel-plated tuners and <br />
Silver-plated frets are installed to last<br />
a lifetime. The body binding and wood<br />
rosette are exquisite.</p>
<p>The Rodriguez Guitar is hand crafted<br />
and glued to create precise balances.<br />
From the invisible careful sanding, even <br />
inside the body, that ensures the<br />
finished instrument's purity of tone,<br />
to the beautifully unique rosette inlays <br />
around the soundhole and on the back of<br />
the neck, each guitar is a credit to its<br />
luthier and worthy of being handed down <br />
from one generation to another.</p>
<p>The tone, resonance and beauty of fine<br />
guitars are all dependent upon the wood<br />
from which they are made. The wood used<br />
in the construction of Rodriguez guitars<br />
is carefully chosen and aged to<br />
guarantee the highest quality. No wood<br />
is purchased before the tree has been<br />
cut down, and at least 2 years must<br />
elapse before the tree is turned into<br />
lumber. The wood has to be well cut<br />
from the log. The grain must be close<br />
and absolutely vertical. The shop is<br />
totally free from humidity.</p>
<p>List Price: $415.00</p>
<p>Your Price: $253.15 (You save $161.85)</p>
