	<h2><a href="mailto:john@stringsandthings.com">John Viola - Our Founder</a></h2>
	<p>John Viola, a classical guitar player, founded our company in 1952.  His goal was to provide a needed 
	resource for both instruments and maintenance of fine string instruments, including repairs and restoration. 
	Although retired, he still can be found helping out at the store.</p>
	
	<h2><a href="mailto:jack@stringsandthings.com">Jack Viola - Our President</a></h2>
	<p>Jack expanded the family business to include electric instruments.  He also moved it from its original 
	location in the Bronx to Westchester County.  Taking over a small warehouse, the company can now offer seminars 
	and workshops.  The facility also is home for a number of musical societies, each with a different focus.  
	Professional music teachers often use our facilities, and once a month, we hold a "Jammin' Weekend for Professional 
	Musicians.</p>
	
	<h2><a href="mailto:gianna@stringsandthings.com">Gianna Viola-Mandolino</a></h2>
	<p>Jack's daughter, Gianna, recently joined the business and expanded the product line to include percussion instruments. 
	Gianna is a projessional drummer for the popular "Girls Havin' Fun" rock band.  </p>
	
	<h2><a href="mailto:tony@stringsandthings.com">Tony Mandolino</a></h2>
	<p>Gianna's husband, Tony Mandolino, has taken over the responsibility for the maintenance and repair 
	services offered at the Strings and Things Guitar Shop.</p>
